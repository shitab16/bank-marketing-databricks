# ML Pipeline on Databricks

Building a machine learning pipeline on Databricks using Spark for a bank marketing use case. The dataset has information about a phone call based marketing campaign that a bank carried out for persuading customers to subscribe a term deposit. The task is to analyse it and identify the patterns that will help finding conclusions in order to develop future strategies to get customers subscribed to a term deposit. Basically, this is going to be a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict if a client will subscribe or not (yes or no).
